GZDoom Mod developed by Batandy, VR enhancedments by Ermac

---

GZ PT is a standalone non-profit GZDOOM based remake of Hideo Kojima's Playable Teaser. While not a 1:1 remake, every sequence has been recreated as close as possible to the original, with low res assets and textures in true retro fashion.
Will you manage to escape the haunted corridor?

This game is completely standalone and can be played without an iwad!
